# SPONGE'S NOTES APP
This is an experimental attempt at a note-taking application made using Windows Forms.
It is fully functional, albeit a bit rough around the edges.
## WRITING PANEL
Write a title (and some content), then save it by pressing the button or using `ctrl`+`s`. 
Includes a `clear`, `save`, `delete`, and `read` button.
## SIDEBAR
Double-click on entries or click them and press the `read` button to open them in the writing panel.
Includes a robust search bar, able to search by title and last date edited.
The drop-down list acts as a folder system. Change the text in the drop-down list when saving a file and a new folder will be created.
## SECRET SETTINGS
Hold `ctrl` while clicking on the maximize button. This will open up a settings panel.
You can customize the colors of the application here and toggle some settings.
## BUGS
This is an old project, and I am aware of some bugs/features not yet implemented.
- content inside the window is weird on resolutions not equal to 1920x1080
- flickering when customizing colors
